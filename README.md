### Step 6:

The above steps in the background invoking the Webhooks and Events API.
It can be used to post Git status to external portals for tracking

### Other Requirements: (Below requirement is tentative, and may change during the actual implementation phase.)
- Create an Github app that will be subscribed to the events of the repo
- We may need to link  the app to process the repo webhooks and get the responses background
- Using the responses build a json response and send it to external portal.  

### Creating webhooks
- Refer the Github developer documentation on, how to enable a webhook for a repo or organisation
- Github develop documentation on [Creating Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/)
- While setting up Webhook, we need to provide Payload URL. It requires exposing localhost of a server.
- Steps to setup localhost server exposed to internet is provided below.

### Configuring a server localhost exposed to internet 
#### Steps
- Using ngrok we can expose a localhost to internet
- First, we'll install a program to expose our local host to the Internet. We'll use ngrok to do this. ngrok is a free download available for all major operating systems
- When you're done with that, you can expose your localhost by running `./ngrok http 4567` on the command line. You should see a line that looks something like this:
```
Forwarding    http://7e9ea9dc.ngrok.io -> 127.0.0.1:4567
```
- Copy that funky *.ngrok.io URL! We're now going to go back to the Payload URL and pasting this server into that field. It should look something like `http://7e9ea9dc.ngrok.io/payload.`
- By doing this, we've set ourselves up to expose our localhost at path /payload to the Internet.
